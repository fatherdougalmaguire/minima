Contrary to what the the site title may lead you to believe, I am not an Irish priest living in exile on a windswept island.

I live in Sydney, Australia and work for the technology arm of a large financial institution.    

That being said, my skills are more technology adjacent.    

But I do own a beautiful black cat.

This isn't him.
