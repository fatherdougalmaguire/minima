Core War pits two programs ( written in simplified programming language called RedCode ) against each other in a virtual computer ( called M.A.R.S or Memory Array Redcode Simulator )

Each program battles each other in attempt to stop the other executing and essentially "win"

My implementation is called LifeOnMars.

It is written for MacOS Sonoma ( v14.0+ ) using Swift/SwiftUI.

LifeOnMars can be found [here](https://github.com/fatherdougalmaguire/LifeOnMARS "LifeOnMars GitHub repository")
